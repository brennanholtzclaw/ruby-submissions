## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?
 - Puts-Puts is a fully playable game with three levels, and more in the works. Pull your cursor back from the ball like a club, then click to swing. "Puts" that ball right in the hole!

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
- Sand Traps:
  - We wanted to incorporate something a little more exciting in the design of a hole, so we implemented an obstacle in the form of sand traps on the first level. This involved a special collision detection, and different hampering of movement, but only while in the trap.

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?
* Easy addition of new levels

While this was a pattern we saw used elsewhere, level creation required customizing for our own needs. It allows all required elements to be created in a easily repeatable pattern.

## Risk Taking
- What risks did you feel you took on this project?

     I think the biggest risk we took was trying to write certain functions for ourselves. When it comes to collision detection, a ball slowing down or being affected by a trap, or even drawing multiple objects, those problems are all solved. We decided we wanted to try and figure them out on our own though to make sure we learned the most we could.

- How do you feel about those risks?
<p>
    Because we had to struggle through some areas that could possibly have been solved faster, I don't think we got as far as we hoped. There are other obstacles that should be much easier to implement now, and other features that we could probably get to fairly quickly, but time escaped us.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?
[Bumper Collision](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/game_time/blob/master/lib/ball.js#L58-L64)

This code not only iterates over the bumbers and obstacles to detect a collision, but also makes it easy to introduce new `bumper.type`s in the future.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

[That's a lot of variables](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/game_time/blob/master/lib/index.js#L1-L27)

Declaring that many variables in the top of a file is the smelliest of code smells that things need to be pulled out into new files/functions, and required differently. Also in this file is the animation loop. Nate did a great job refactoring that, but the whole index is still pretty cluttered with things that need some desperate pruning. We just ran into problems getting specific functions pulled out, and still working correctly in our loop.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
[Link to pastebin](http://pastebin.com/KQPqpvCu)

I was not able to debug this, but one file of my tests only runs when run solo, and fails as a suite. I suspect it's something to do with clean up on the tests, but wasn't able to identify it. This only represents 5 tests.

### Test Breakdown
- How Many Unit Tests?
Roughly 31

- How Many Feature/Integration Tests?
- Roughly 9


### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a unit test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'
[Unit test of collision detection on (literally) a corner case](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/game_time/blob/master/test/balls_in_obstacles_test.js)

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a feature test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

## Instructor Feedback

- Points: (base 300)

#### Playability Features

We want your game to be full-featured and playable -- not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features.

To this end, make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
Allow the user to start a new game
Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
Score Tracking: How this works will vary by game, but at the end of the game, generate a score for the winning player
Scoreboard -- track scores across multiple game sessions. Since we aren't incorporating a server for our games, client-side storage like a cookie or LocalStorage will suffice.
Create multiple rounds of difficulty. (consider increasing factors such as game speed, randomness of starting setup, etc)

#### Extensions

Create an AI player that can play as the second player (except in 2048).
Multiplayer support -- either by sharing a keyboard (2 sets of key inputs) or, as an extra-difficult extension, via websockets between multiple browsers

#### Evaluation Rubric

There are 300 total available points for this project.

150 are available at each of three check-ins and are at instructor descretion.

Teams must complete the submission form prior to each check-in.

150 out of a total of 300 points are included in the rubric below. The additional 150 feature points will be determined during iteration planning with instructors during check-ins.

#### Functional Expectations

35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors
- Great job!

#### User Interface

13 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
- Very usable, a few spots that could get cleaned up for better user experience

#### Testing

30 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite convers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

#### JavaScript Style

25 points - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or now duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

15 points - Zero complaints
