# Brennan Extra Credit

I started a podcast during the tail-end of my first time through module 1.

Publishing is usually sporadic, but this module I have tried (successfully) to publish every week.

Topics this module have included a two-part piece with Lia on job hunting during and after Turing, A State of Turing talk with Jeff, and a Turing recap with Rachel. Plans for this week are a wrap-up (focused on the diabolical projects he's created) with Horace, and next week, despite not being here on Friday, I'm planning on doing a general Turing wrap-up with 1511.
