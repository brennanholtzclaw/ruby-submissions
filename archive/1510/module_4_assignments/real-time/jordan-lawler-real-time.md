# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[survey-store](https://github.com/Jlawlzz/real-time/blob/master/src/survey-store.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

###### I really like how clean this code is. It is simple but it is effective and effecient.

[Router](https://github.com/Jlawlzz/real-time/blob/master/src/path-router.js)

###### The router really helped to clean up my server file.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[sad](https://github.com/Jlawlzz/real-time/blob/master/views/render-survey-public.ejs)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code?

###### My worst code is without a doubt in my views. This file being particularly bad, I am not a huge fan of embeded html so naturaly this looks less than desirable to me. That being said I am glad I tried out .ejs to get a feel for the format!

## Instructor Feedback

Notes: 

- UI: URL links should be relative - makes it really hard to demo/use the app that they are just endpoints
- Strange flash of a different view when you refresh the page on a poll
- User can vote multiple times just by refreshing the page - unexpected behavior
- `node_modules` commited and pushed to Github
- [console.log committed](https://github.com/Jlawlzz/real-time/blob/master/public/survey-create.js#L16)
- Nice way to split up server side code!

### Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?

* 75 points - Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.

### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 25 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Client-Side Application

* 25 points - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.

### Test-Driven Development

* 20 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. One or more enpoints are not tested or the internal business logic is not fully tested.

### Interface

* 4 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Workflow

* 4 points - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
