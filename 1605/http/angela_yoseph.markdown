Notes:
* All functionality works
* 35 tests
* Generally good tests, make sure you test for different cases, and for
possible edge cases.
* Generally well written code, there are some opportunities to refactor
complex conditionals and longer conditional branches.
* Opportunity to refactor messages out into a module, look at how you can reduce
reliance on instance variables

##a 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
