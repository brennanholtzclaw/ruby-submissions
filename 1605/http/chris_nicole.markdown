Notes: 

* diagnostic data works
* /hello increments counter -- make sure only for this path
* datetime and shutdown both work
* iter 3 word search works
* I4 & I5 working
* when initializing an object, don't have any other side effects; use a method for that


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
