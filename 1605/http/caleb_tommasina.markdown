Notes:
* 16 tests
* Faraday tests were not implemented
* Some opportunities to refactor were present, things like complex conditionals
pulling messages out to a separate place
* Some methods/classes doing a bit too much
* really liked the runner pulled out

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
