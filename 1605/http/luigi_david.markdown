Notes:


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3.5

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension
* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3.5

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

(keep in mind that tests should be indifferent to what has happened in the past -- control your output) 

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
