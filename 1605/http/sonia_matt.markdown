Notes:
* 30 tests
* Well separated code
* some opportunities to refactor, look at complex conditionals and inside
conditional branches
* well tested, make sure that you're testing multiple cases in the future


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
