Notes:
* butthole is not a known word. (note: Roberta did not check to see if butthole
was a word)
* 41 assertions
* Well written tests, some edge cases could use more attention.
* Some opportunities to refactor for clarity, specifically, conditionals and
branches in conditionals
* Overall, very well organized.
* Good use of modules, some could be added to, but not too much


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
