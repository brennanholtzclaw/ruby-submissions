Notes:
* 25 tests
* In tests, make sure that we are testing more than the initial case of an item
Make sure that state of the things are changing in the way that we expect them to
* Make sure to cover multiple cases in tests, so that a hardcoded response
from any method will not continue to make tests pass.
* There are many opportunities to refactor for clarity and to separate out responsibilities.


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
