Notes:

* Game has a clean REPL interface
* Prints the board each time and updates on the computer's actions
* Have a few bugs in the gameplay but mostly works
* able to express complex ideas in code and get it to behave in the way that is needed
* still seeing a lot of procedural style methods -- ok for now but especially with some more
diligent application of various enumerable techniques I think we can quickly get a lot of this cleaned up
* Obviously need to work on the testing pieces quite a bit
* doing a good job identifying component classes for the project -- dont be afraid to lean on these a little
more heavily -- some of the logic in the large Game class could have moved into other helper classes

Scores:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
