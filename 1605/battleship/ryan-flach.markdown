Notes:

* quite a solid project
* especially successful in the testing, which has noticeable implications for the general cleanliness of the code
* objects are well-structured, fully own their data, and are used effectively in combination with one another
* biggest code patterns we looked were using various data manipulation techniques to reduce large branching
in code
* e.g. using hashes to represent different value choices, using boolean (|| &&) operators to combine multi-pronged
true/false statements, and reduce repetitve branches of an if/else into enumerable operations on some kind of collection

Scores:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty
