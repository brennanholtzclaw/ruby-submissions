Notes: - strived to break things into SRP could refactor to solidify concept a little more 
       
       - Code is readable and doesn't have too many long methods
       
       - could of easily gotten the 3 but student was sick. 

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested. #soft 3 


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
