Notes: - did a great job of breaking project into smaller parts. 
      - could refactor "smaller parts" ie. procs, and modules 
      - testing showed knowledge of problem, could accomidate edge cases 

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
