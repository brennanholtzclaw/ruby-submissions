Notes:

* 16 tests all passing
* Remember to test for edge cases, and for file stuff.
* Each file of code should have a corresponding test file
* every method should have its own test. At least one.

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
