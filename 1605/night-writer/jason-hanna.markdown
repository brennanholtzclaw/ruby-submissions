Notes:
* converting to braille adds capitalization
* 13 tests, all passes
* very clean approach to the code
* missing one extension
* pull file writing class to its own file to DRY
* need some tests for file writing
* loved the fact everything was in one converter class
* code accidentally capitalizes when converting to braille


Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
