Notes: - glimpse of SRP implementation not completely there 
       - Tests communicated to me that developer was there logically but tests were failing 
       - Test where cascading in complexity which I liked
       - application could not convert from braille 

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1.5: Application only converts to Braille or from Braille

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Minor mutations to the implementation code, such as swaping characters, changing `<` to `<=`, placing `true` into a conditional, or deleting a line of code which break the functionality do not cause any tests to fail.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
