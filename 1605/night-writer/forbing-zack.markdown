Notes:
* He started thinking about immutability using constants in his tests.
* He used inheritance to share functionality among classes.
* Created a support folder to store the text files that he was using in his tests.
* Overall, I think he has the right instincts and good handling of abstractions. With a bit of guidance, he'll do really well. I think he'll enjoy reading `POODR`.

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
