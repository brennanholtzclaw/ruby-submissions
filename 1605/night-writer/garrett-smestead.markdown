Notes:
* Program works, does not wrap past 80 characters.
* Numbers extensions
* 31 tests, 38 assertions
* tests generally good, make sure you hit edge cases
* watch for consistency in namign
* Pull file writing out to its own class - one file per class

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully (Missing wrapping)

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
