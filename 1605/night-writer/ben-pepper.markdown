Notes:

* clean code
* converts from English to Braille
* talked about refactoring three methods into one by identifying the dynamic value
* try using enumerables instead of while in order to iterate

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1.5: Application only converts English to Braille (internals of Braille to English working, missing file read/write for Braille to English)

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Conversion class is well tested; would like to see File Accessor class tested in addition to functionality that is not yet implemented. 

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities (would like to see mulitiple components pattern continue to be used for building out remaining functionality.
