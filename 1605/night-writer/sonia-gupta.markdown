Notes:
* 23 tests, 27 assertions, all pass
* test that file actually reads
* Good clean code, great use of some advanced enumerables such as Group_by with
with_index
* Methods well separated.
* try to avoid instance variables to hold things that arent about a things state.

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
