Notes: soft 3s for tdd and breaking logic into components. 
      - could look at creating the brailer converter into 2 classes (eng - braille) (braille - eng)
      - a lot of loops but adhearing to the speck she passes. 

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
