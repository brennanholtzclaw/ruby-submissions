Notes: - super granular which I really like 
       - conceptually and implementation really worked on SRP
       - tranlating bralle effectively limited some of the scores 
       - concepts are there. would like to see them polished out. 

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2.5: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
 deleting a line of code which break the functionality do not cause any tests to fail.


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3.5: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
