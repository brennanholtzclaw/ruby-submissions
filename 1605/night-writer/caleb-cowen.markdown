Notes: - really worked on testing one method. 
       - might consider breaking somethings (hash) into a module for refactoring 
       - Has one method that gave him but with a little refactoring could get the numbers translation to work. 
       - didnt' get extension but is holding himself to a high standard. #ilikethat

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2.5: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3.5:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
